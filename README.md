KeySnail
========

KeySnail is an add-on for Mozilla Firefox that aims to be a competitor
and lightweight alternative to
[Vimperator](http://www.vimperator.org/vimperator). Unlike Vimperator,
*KeySnail provides comfortable browsing experience for Emacs users*,
but its target users are not limited to.

See https://github.com/mooz/keysnail/wiki for details.
